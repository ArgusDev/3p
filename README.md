# 3p Test

### Prerequisites
Visual Studio 2017 was used to build the solution.
'3p.Library.Service' is a ASP.NET Core project. I believe Unit tests should run even if your Visual Studio environment cannot open/build this project.

### Limitations
The solution does not include a bunch of framework elements that real solution should have like:
* Exception handling
* Logging
* Authentication and authorization
* Comments, classes, members description
* Real Data Access layer (only mock)
* Some other components and framework that may provide some benefits in real development process
